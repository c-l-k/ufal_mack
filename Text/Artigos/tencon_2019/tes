< Currently, in the area of remote sensing, you can find different methods for detection and fusion of edge evidence. However, some of these methods, when applied to PolSAR images, produce inadequate results. In order to improve signal noise, there has been an investment in research with the use of statistical modeling. The present study proposes a method of detection and fusion of evidence edges based on the method of maximum likelihood, using a fusion of information by average, SWT, PCA, and ROC statistics. The precedents were applied to the intensity channels of a PolSAR real image. The results indicate a good performance of the method in detecting edges with possible paths for future research.

Seeking to understand the importance of information from each of these channels in the fusion of evidence of edges. The proposed algorithm was applied in three intensity channels (hh), (hv) and (vv).
