< \section{Conclusion}\label{sec_08}

< In this study, the statistical modelling approach was applied to real PolSAR data imaging. Seeking to understand the importance of information from each of these channels in the fusion of evidence of edges. The proposed algorithm was applied in three intensity channels (hh), (hv) and (vv). Initially, we found the evidence of edges, using the method of maximum likelihood in each of the channels, obtaining good results. When analysing the results obtained in the three channels, it was observed that the method for the detection of edges worked well in the channels (hh) and (hv) achieving better accuracy in relation to the channel (vv).

Aiming to understand the importance of information from each channel in the edge evidence fusions, the proposed algorithm was applied in three intensity channels (hh), (hv) and (vv). Initially, it was found the evidence of edges, using the maximum likelihood  method in each channel, obtaining good results. After analyzed the results obtained in the three channels, it was observed that the method for the edge detections worked better in the channels (hh) and (hv) than the channel (vv), achieving a suitable accuracy.

< Subsequently, the fusion of evidence of edges was performed with the methods of simple mean, SWT, PCA and ROC statistics. The first three methods performed well as shown in the results. The ROC statistics method suppressed several edge points, a behaviour expected because it is a method that uses thresholds; however, when applied in a larger number of channels, its performance tends to improve.
