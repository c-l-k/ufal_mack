  abstract  = {This article proposes a technique for boundary detection in speckled imagery based on active contours and on the statistical properties of speckled data. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), sonar, B-ultrasound and laser imagery is corrupted by a signal-dependent non-additive noise called speckle. Many statistical models have been proposed to describe this noise, aiming at the development of specialized techniques for image improvement and analysis. The G0 distribution is a statistical model that succeeds in describing a wide range of areas as, for instance in {SAR} data, pastures (smooth), forests (rough) and urban (extremely rough) areas. In order to determine boundaries between different areas, dynamic B-splines are proposed in this paper. The algorithm automatically finds seeds and regions boundaries by a decision rule based on the estimation of the parameters of the G0 law. The proposed algorithm is tested on synthetic and real {SAR} images, and both the accuracy and the performance of the proposal are assessed.},

abstract="One of the main problems of {SAR} imagery is the presence of speckle noise, originated by the inherent coherent nature of this type of systems. For one-dimensional {SAR} systems it has been demonstrated that speckle can be considered as a multiplicative noise term. Nevertheless, this simple model cannot be exported when multidimensional {SAR} imagery is addressed. This paper is devoted to present the latest advances into the definition of a multidimensional speckle noise model which does not depend on the data dimensionality. Speckle noise may be modeled by multiplicative and additive noise sources, whose combination is determined by the data's correlation structure. The validity of the proposed model is demonstrated by its application to a real L-band multidimensional {SAR} dataset acquired by the German ESAR sensor.",

Abstract = {We present an approach for polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image region boundary detection based on the use of B-Spline active contours and a new model for polarimetric {SAR} data: the GHP distribution. In order to detect the boundary of a region, initial B-Spline curves are specified, either automatically or manually, and the proposed algorithm uses a deformable contours technique to find the boundary. In doing this, the parameters of the polarimetric GHP model for the data are estimated, in order to find the transition points between the region being segmented and the surrounding area. This is a local algorithm since it works only on the region to be segmented. Results of its performance are presented.},

ABSTRACT = {A new electromagnetic approach for the simulation of polarimetric {SAR} images is proposed. It starts from Maxwell?s equations, employs the spectral domain full-wave technique, the moment method, and the stationary phase method to compute the far electromagnetic fields scattered by multilayer structures. A multilayer structure is located at each selected position of a regular rectangular grid of coordinates, which defines the scene area under imaging. The grid is determined taking into account the elementary scatter size and {SAR} operational parameters, such as spatial resolution, pixel spacing, look angle and platform altitude. A two-dimensional separable ?sinc? function to represent the {SAR} spread point function is also considered. Multifrequency sets of single-look polarimetric {SAR} images are generated, in L-, C- and X-bands and the images are evaluated using several measurements commonly employed in {SAR} data analysis. The evaluation shows that the proposed simulation process is working properly, since the obtained results are in accordance with those presented in the literature. Therefore, this new approach becomes suitable for carrying out theoretical and practical studies using polarimetric {SAR} images.},

abstract="Extraction of features, such as edges for the understanding of aerial images, has been an important objective since the early days of remote sensing. This work aims at describing a new framework which allows for the quantitative combination of a preselected set of edge detectors based on the correspondence between their outcomes. This is inspired from the problem that despite the enormous amount of literature on edge detection techniques, there is no single technique that performs well in every possible image context. Two approaches are proposed for this purpose. The first approach is the well-known receiver operating characteristics analysis which is introduced for a sound quality evaluation of the edge maps estimated by combining different edge detectors. In the second approach, the so-called kappa statistics are employed in a novel fashion to amalgamate the above-mentioned selected edge maps to form an improved final edge image. This method is unique in the sense that the balance between the false detections (false positives and false negatives) is explicitly determined in advance and incorporated in the proposed method in a mathematical fashion. For the performance evaluation of the proposed techniques, a sample set of the RADIUS/DARPA-IU Fort Hood aerial image database with known ground truth has been used.",

A revolution has taken place in remote sensing and allied fields such as computer science, engineering, and geography. Petabytes of satellite imagery have become publicly accessible at increasing resolution, many algorithms for extracting meaningful social science information from these images are now routine, and modern cloud-based processing power allows these algorithms to be run at global scale. This paper seeks to introduce economists to the science of remotely sensed data, and to give a flavor of how this new source of data has been used by economists so far and what might be done in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {Knowledge of the exact statistical properties of the signal plays an important role in the applications of Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) data. In the last three decades, a considerable research effort has been devoted to finding accurate statistical models for PolSAR data, and a number of distributions have been proposed. In order to see the differences of various models and to make a comparison among them, a survey is provided in this paper. Texture models, which could capture the non-Gaussian behavior observed in high resolution data, and yet keep a compact mathematical form, are mainly explained. Probability density functions for the single look data and the multilook data are reviewed, as well as the advantages and applicable context of those models. As a summary, challenges in the area of statistical analysis of PolSAR data are also discussed.},
