  abstract  = {This article proposes a technique for boundary detection in speckled imagery based on active contours and on the statistical properties of speckled data. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), sonar, B-ultrasound and laser imagery is corrupted by a signal-dependent non-additive noise called speckle. Many statistical models have been proposed to describe this noise, aiming at the development of specialized techniques for image improvement and analysis. The G0 distribution is a statistical model that succeeds in describing a wide range of areas as, for instance in SAR data, pastures (smooth), forests (rough) and urban (extremely rough) areas. In order to determine boundaries between different areas, dynamic B-splines are proposed in this paper. The algorithm automatically finds seeds and regions boundaries by a decision rule based on the estimation of the parameters of the G0 law. The proposed algorithm is tested on synthetic and real SAR images, and both the accuracy and the performance of the proposal are assessed.},

abstract="One of the main problems of SAR imagery is the presence of speckle noise, originated by the inherent coherent nature of this type of systems. For one-dimensional SAR systems it has been demonstrated that speckle can be considered as a multiplicative noise term. Nevertheless, this simple model cannot be exported when multidimensional SAR imagery is addressed. This paper is devoted to present the latest advances into the definition of a multidimensional speckle noise model which does not depend on the data dimensionality. Speckle noise may be modeled by multiplicative and additive noise sources, whose combination is determined by the data's correlation structure. The validity of the proposed model is demonstrated by its application to a real L-band multidimensional SAR dataset acquired by the German ESAR sensor.",
